Deploy your Dart web application with ease using Nginx. The package is designed to work seamlessly with Nginx, providing robust and scalable server management suitable for production environments.

### 8. SMTP Email Sending
Send emails directly from your web application using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). This feature is essential for functionalities like user registration, password recovery, and sending notifications.

### 9. Comprehensive Data Handling Tools
Simplify web development with built-in tools for managing common data structures such as Strings, Maps, and Lists. These utilities include string encoding and manipulation, as well as efficient handling of Maps and Lists, reducing the need for additional packages.

### 10. Advanced Routing with Authentication and Permissions
Handle client-side request routing effectively with built-in support for managing authentication and permissions. Define secure routes and control access to various parts of your application effortlessly.

### 11. Easy Socket Request Development
Develop and manage Socket requests with ease. The WebApp package provides intuitive APIs to handle Socket connections, enabling real-time data exchange and interactive features in your web application.

### 12. MVC Architecture for Scalability
Scale large projects effortlessly using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. Extend the provided classes such as `WaController`, `DBModel`, and `DBCollection` to structure your application logically and maintainably.

### 13. Form Validators
Utilize built-in FormValidators to manage and validate client-side data on the server. This feature ensures data integrity and security by validating API requests and user inputs effectively.

### 14. CronJob Development
Implement scheduled tasks quickly using the `WaCron` class. Automate routine operations, such as data backups or periodic data processing, with minimal configuration.

### 15. Flexible Output Rendering
Render client requests using various methods, including JSON, HTML, Text, Widgets, and variable dumps. The package supports multiple output formats, allowing you to present data in the most appropriate form for your users.

### 16. Asset Management
Manage and include assets effortlessly during request rendering. Extend the `Layout` class and use the `include_controller` to add and manage assets, ensuring your application resources are well-organized and easily accessible.

### Simple WebApp Server example:
   ```dart
   WaConfigs configs = WaConfigs(
  widgetsPath: pathTo('./example/widgets'),
  widgetsType: 'j2.html',
  languagePath: pathTo('./example/languages'),
  port: 8085,
  dbConfig: WaDBConfig(enable: false),
  publicDir: pathTo('./example/public'),
);
WaServer server = WaServer(configs: configs);

final socketManager = SocketManager(
  server,
  event: SocketEvent(
    onConnect: (socket) {
      server.socketManager?.sendToAll(
        'New user connected! count: ${server.socketManager?.countClients}',
        path: 'output',
      );
      socket.send(
        {'message': 'Soccuess connect to socket!'},
        path: 'connected',
      );
    },
    onMessage: (socket, data) {},
    onDisconnect: (socket) {
      var count = server.socketManager?.countClients ?? 0;
      server.socketManager?.sendToAll(
        'User disconnected! count: ${count - 1}',
        path: 'output',
      );
    },
  ),
  routes: getSocketRoute(),
);

void main() async {
  server.addRouting(getWebRoute);
  server.start().then((value) {
    Console.p('Example app started: http://localhost:${value.port}');
  });
}
   ```

### Email SMTP example:

   import 'package:mailer/smtp_server.dart';
   
   bool success = await MailSender.sendEmail(
     from: 'sender@example.com',
