/// Base controller class for handling HTTP requests in the web application.
/// [WaController] serves as the foundation for all request handlers in the framework.
/// It provides access to the current request context and implements the [RouteRepos]
/// interface for standardized request handling. Controllers are typically used to
/// organize related request handling logic and can be associated with routes to
/// process incoming HTTP requests.
/// the [rq] getter, eliminating the need to pass request objects manually.
/// This design leverages the Zone-based [RequestContext] system for thread-safe
/// request handling.
/// - Thread-safe request handling through Zone isolation
/// - Standardized interface for index route handling
/// - Built-in string representation for debugging and introspection
/// Example usage:
///   @override
///   Future&lt;String&gt; index() async {
///     final users = await userService.getAllUsers();
///     return rq.renderJson(users);
///   }
